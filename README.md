🔬 Currently a Graduate Research Assistant at Dr. María Rivera's lab, focusing on annotating genes from the gut microbiome of Bess Beetles. Using stand-alone pipelines, I investigate why larvae thrive solely on a diet of feces from their elders.

📘 Concurrently pursuing a Software Engineering certification from the Institute of Data and VCU, enhancing skills in software design, development, and deployment.

🎓 Planning to leverage my research and software engineering expertise in pursuit of a PhD in Bioinformatics, aiming to contribute to understanding complex biological systems through computational approaches.
